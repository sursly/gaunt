## Free Minimal Wordpress Theme
### Demo at [gaunt.madebytyler.com](https://gaunt.madebytyler.com)

Just upload this to your themes folder, activate, and party. To use a custom logo you need to have Jetpack installed, then go to the Appearance > Customize and add it there. Here are some other tips and things to know

***

* The Home page shows the latest post (not page). If you use a featured image in the post, that will show, otherwise, a beautiful gradient will be the circle background.
* For best results, set your media sizes as: Thumbnail- 300  x 300 (crop to exact), Medium-1000 x 1000, Large 2000 x 2000. No worries if you’ve already sized things differently, update your media settings, install the Regenerate Thumbnail Plugin and batch resize them all.
* There are no post types, other than a standard post
* The “sidebar” is shown before the footer on this site (gray background area, below). You can customize this via “appearance>widgets” in WordPress.
* If a page has children, they will show on the parent page ONLY if that parent has the “show children” page template activated.
* If you use a “featured image” (not required) it will show as a page thumbnail, otherwise a gray circle will appear.
* If want to use a featured image JUST for the sake of a thumbnail (and not a header/hero image) choose the page template “minimal” (this will hide the featured image on the actual page, and also hide the sidebar).
* There’s only so much room: by using a primary menu (in appearance) you can put as many things in as you want, but I’d suggest limiting it to five. This is a philosophy AND design decision. It’ll force you to be brief.
* Here’s an example of a page with a featured image (if no featured image is chosen, no big deal, page content will just start below the title)
* Gaunt is very responsive!  Jetpack + Photon could make it even snappier on a mobile view, as could a lazy load plugin. Those are easily installable, so I’ll leave it up to you.
* There are no plugins required to make Gaunt work. I am using the Fluid Video Embed plugin for responsive video, but you don’t need that if you’re not embedding video.
* There are no dropdowns/submenus. You can make them all you want in the back end (Appearance: Menu) but they won’t show up.
* Comments will not show, ever, but you could get a disable comments plugin if you want reinforcement.
